# DeepXPression
3D life simulator in Unreal Engine, based on interactions between the main character and the environment and decision making, aiming to convey a socially relevant message. The player controls a man with major depressive disorder, and each decision has effects on its world. Experience, world, characters and dialogues were designed in Articy:draft 3.

## Repository content
This repository contains:
* The entire UnrealEngine project
* 'ArticyDraft3_Deep-X-Pression.zip', containing the design of the experience in Articy:draft 3 (you can find it in External_Resources)
* Two .pdf files, one containing a draft ("Bozza") of the project proposal and the other containing the entire design document of the experience

## Disclaimer
Feel free to use this project as you prefer. You can either clone this repo or download it locally.
* The UnrealEngine project, developed using the 5.1 version, can be imported by opening the .uproject file or by locating it from the UnrealEngine project viewer.
* TwinMotionContent plugin is needed to correctly view the static meshes and textures of some assets: if you don't want to download 20/30GB of this plugin when less than 0,01% of it is used, just edit the .uproject file and remove the lines regarding it (you can find some guides on the web).
* Another plugin, DlgSystem, is used to manage the dialogues with secondary characters and the interactions with the game world. By opening the project, you will be asked to compile those plugins, and Visual Studio + .NET components are needed.
* After compiling, the project will eventually be opened. Use the Play button to start the simulation of the game. After starting the simulation, press F11 to enjoy it in fullscreen mode.
For further information, please refer to the last page of the design document.
